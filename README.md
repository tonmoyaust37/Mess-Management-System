# Mess-Management-System

This project is done as a part of our software development Course in Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. This project aims to provide comprehensive information portal about mess. It is developed mainly for students who live in mess or hostel. In this system users can access all the functions of the mess and will able to calculate their costs and store all data to compare easily.
There will be two types of user-
